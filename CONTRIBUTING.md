# Creating a PR

Just create a new pull request if you want to make an update. We would prefer that you open an issue describing the update first if possible!

For now, please request Swapnil at [@swapnil712](https://github.com/swapnil712) to review.

If you want to speak to us before doing lots of work, just email get in touch with one of the moderators (see **README**) - we're very responsive and friendly!
